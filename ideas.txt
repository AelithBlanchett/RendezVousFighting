During rest, the recovered hp should scale with full Willpower rather than Willpower/2.
Change ranged so that it uses DEX/2 for damage instead of full DEX. (Then player have a choice between pumping up DEXfor accurate but less pwoerful ranged atatcks or going for a balance between DEX and INT which gives them less accurate, but more damaging attacks.)
Light Attack damage could also be the max of STR and DEX/2.
